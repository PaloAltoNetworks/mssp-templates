General Device Configuration
----------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides templated configurations for general device
settings.

Security-related Device Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`device_setting`

General device settings that effect security posture. Found in Device > Setup in the GUI.

    + Wildfire: set optimal file size limits for Wildfire uploads and show verdict responses for grayware, malware and phishing

    + X-Forwarded-For: To ensure that attackers canâ€™t read and exploit the XFF values in web request packets that exit the firewall.

        * Enable the firewall to use XFF values in policies and in the source user fields of logs
        * Remove XFF values from outgoing web requests.

    + Session rematch: the firewall will go through all the existing sessions and apply the new security policy to any matching traffic

    + Notify User: user should be notified when web-application is blocked; enables the application response page

    + Log Suppression: disabled to ensure unique log entries even if similar session types

    + Prevent TCP and UDP buffer overflow and multi-part HTTP download evasions

        * Disable 'allow HTTP header range'
        * Disable 'tcp-bypass-exceed-queue'
        * Disable 'udp-bypass-exceed-queue'

    + Enable high DP load logging

    + Prevent App-ID buffer overflow evasion

        * set bypass-exceed-queue to 'no'

    + Prevent TCP and MPTCP evasions

        * set urgent data to 'clear'
        * set drop zero flag to 'yes'
        * set bypass-exceed-oo-queue to 'no'
        * set check-timestamp-option to 'yes'
        * set strip-mptcp-option to yes


System Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`device_system`

System configuration settings for dynamic updates and network services
(eg. DNS, NTP).

    + Update schedule settings

        * Turn on all telemetry settings
        * Check every 30 minutes for new threat signatures
        * Hourly checks for new AV signatures
        * Check every minute for new Wildfire signatures
        * Recommended time delays and thresholds for checks and installs

    + Use SNMPv3

    + Set default DNS and NTP values

    + Set timezone to UTC

    + Provide a standard login banner warning for unauthorized users

.. Note::
    The management config types include static, dhcp-client, or dhcp-cloud as a special case of dhcp-client.
    This is specific to each deployment and can be selected as part of the tools to build ```my_config```.
    Since management interface is in the template config, this option must be included for deployment.

Logging
-------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Logging best practice configurations for logging output and forwarding
profiles.

.. Warning::
    **Configure logging profiles before security rules**
    The template creates a log forwarding profile call default.
    This profile is referenced in the template security rules and should be configured before the security rules.

.. Note::
    **Logging can be deployment dependent**
    The destination in the logging profile is templated to an unroutable syslog server address.
    This can vary based on actual deployment scenarios.


Log forwarding profile
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`log_settings_profiles`

Log forward profile referenced in security rules to determine where to
forward log related events.

    + Forward all log activity to syslog (see the reference syslog
      configuration in shared_log_settings.xml)

    + Email malicious and phishing Wildfire verdicts to the address in the
      email profile (see shared_log_settings.xml)

Device log settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`shared_log_settings`

Device event logging including sample profiles for email and syslog
forwarding.

    + Reference syslog profile that can be edited for a specific IP
      address and UDP/TCP port

    + Reference email profile that can be edited for specific email domain
      and user information

    + System, configuration, user, HIP, and correlation log forwarding to
      syslog

    + Email critical system events to the email profile


.. Note::
    **When to use email alerts**
    The purpose of select email alert forwarding is ensure not to under alert or over alert yet provide critical messages for key events.
    Under alerting reduces visibility to key events while over alerting creates too much noise in the system.
    The templates are set with a median view to capture key events without too much 'log fatigue' noise


Referenced Objects
------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Address, External Dynamic List (EDL), and tag objects that are
referenced in security rules by name.


Address Object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


:panosrepo:`address`

Address object used to reference named addresses.


        + Sinkhole-IPv4: IP address used in security rule to block sinkhole
          traffic

        + Sinkhole-IPv6: IP address used in security rule to block sinkhole
          traffic


External Dynamic Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`external_list`


Used for the firewall to pull in external elements such as IP, URL, or
domain used in security rules

    + Team Cymru Bogon Lists - IPv4 and IPv6 bogon IPs that should not be
      forwarded

.. Warning::
    **Remove private bogons**
    Any private or other Bogon address that must be routed across the
    device must be added as exceptions in the external dynamic list
    object. These should be direction dependent and used in the respective
    outbound or inbound security rule.


Tags
~~~~

:panosrepo:`tag`

Tags used in security rules and related objects.

        + Inbound - inbound (untrust to trust) elements

        + Outbound - outbound (trust to untrust) elements

        + Internal - internal (trust) segmentation elements


Security Profiles and Groups
----------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------

The key elements for security posture are security profiles and the
security rules. The templates ensure best practice profiles and
profile groups are available and can be referenced in any security
rules. The template security rules focus on 'top of the list' block
rules to reduce the attack surface.


.. Warning::
    **Profiles and subscriptions**
    All of the template security profiles other than file blocking require
    Threat Prevention, URL Filtering, and Wildfire subscriptions. Ensure
    that the device is properly licensed before applying these
    configurations.



Custom URL Category
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`profiles_custom_url_category`

Placeholder for custom url categories used in security rules and url
profiles. Using these categories prevents the need to modify the
default template.


        + Black-List: placeholder to be used in block rules and objects to
          override default template behavior

        + White-List: placeholder to be used in permit rules and objects to
          override default template behavior

        + Custom-No-Decrypt: to be used in the decryption no-decrypt rule to
          specify URLs that should not be decrypted



File Blocking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`profiles_file_blocking`

Security profile for actions specific to file blocking (FB).


.. Note::
    **File blocking and file types**
    The Block file type recommendation is based on common malicious file
    types with minimal impact in a Day 1 deployment. Although PE is
    considered the highest risk file type it is also used for legitimate
    purposes so blocking PE files will be deployment specific and not
    included in the template.

        + Day 1 Block file types: 7z, bat, chm, class, cpl, dll, hlp, hta,
          jar, ocx, pif, scr, torrent, vbe, wsf

        + The profiles will alert on all other file types for logging purposes


Profiles:

        + Outbound-FB: For outbound (trust to untrust) security rules

        + Inbound-FB: For inbound (untrust to trust) security rules

----------------------------------------------------------------------


Recommended Block Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:panosrepo:`rulebase_security`

Recommended block rules for optimal security posture with associated
default log-forwarding profile


        + Outbound Block Rule: Block destination IP address match based on the
          Palo Alto Networks predefined externals dynamic lists

        + Inbound Block Rule: Block source IP address match based on the Palo
          Alto Networks predefined externals dynamic lists

        + DNS Sinkhole Block: Block sessions redirected to defined sinkhole
          addresses using the address objects (address.xml)

        + Inbound/Outbound Bogon Block Rules: Prevent bogon addresses from
          being forwarded; uses Team Cymru Bogon EDL


.. Warning::
    **Check Bogons before enabling the Bogon block rule**
    The bogon rules are disabled in the template and should only be
    activated once determined that all bogons should be blocked.
    Exceptions may be private address space that may be allowed to cross
    device boundaries.

.. Note::
    **Security rules in the template are block only**
    The template only uses block rules. Allow rules are zone, direction

Series of reports to look for traffic anomalies, where to apply or
remove rules, etc. Reports are grouped by topic per the report group
section below.


.. Note::
    **Zones and Subnets in report queries**
    The repo contains a separate folder for custom reports that use a
    placeholder zone called 'internet' for match conditions in reports.
    This value MUST be changed to match the actual public zone used in a
    live network. Additional zones and/or subnets to be used or excluded
    in the reports would be added in the query values.
