Formula-based Excel Spreadsheet
===============================

For users who want to customize their configuration before loading without the use of python utilities, this is a preferred
model for configuration.


The spreadsheets can be found at :setcommands:`panos` and :setcommands:`panorama`


The ``values`` worksheet can be updated with user-specific values. Formulas embedded in the ``set commands`` worksheet
will use the user added values.

Once the spreadsheet is updated, the traditional copy-and-paste model can be used to load the configuration using the CLI.


.. Warning::
    The set commands use formulas referencing cells in the values worksheet. Use caution if making changes to the base
    spreadsheet to avoid incorrect references to cell values.
