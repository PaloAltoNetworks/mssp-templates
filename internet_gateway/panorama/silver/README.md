# Silver template

This template aligns with a security device that has a Threat Protection
license but no URL Filtering or Wildfire subscriptions.

Threat Protection uses standard iron-skillet base configuration. Although
iron-skillet is designed for the Gold level tier, the silver Internet Gateway
will load the configuration and disable unlicenses features.
