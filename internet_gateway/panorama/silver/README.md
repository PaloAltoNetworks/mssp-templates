# Silver template

This template aligns with a security device that has a Threat Protection
license but no URL Filtering or Wildfire subscriptions.

Threat Protection uses standard IronSkillet base configuration. Although
IronSkillet is designed for the Gold level tier, the silver Internet Gateway
will load the configuration and disable unlicenses features.
