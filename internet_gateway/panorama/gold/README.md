# Gold template

This template assumes the device has the following licenses:

* Threat Protection

* URL Filtering

* Wildfire

This provides the highest level of security aligned with best practices.

Outbound rules are created using the recommended profile settings from
the IronSkillet day one configuration.

In addition, a security rule to provide more aggressive file-blocking
for unknown category URLs has been added.
