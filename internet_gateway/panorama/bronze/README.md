# Bronze template

This is the most basic template that can be deployed without additional
subscriptions for Threat Protection, URL Filtering, or Wildfire.

The template is based on the iron-skillet day one best practice but
DOES NOT have best practice features enabled. Use with caution.

Without subscriptions, the only security profile element used is
file blocking.
